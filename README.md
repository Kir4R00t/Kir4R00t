### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing my skills as a programmer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on learning Python however I know basics of many other languages (such as HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL) 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any cool project so that I can get even more experienced as a programmer
- âš¡ Fun fact: Currently I own 4 tarantulas and I'm looking forward to expand my collection
- ðŸ”¥ I strongly appreciate the practicality of the applications I create
