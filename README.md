### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing my programming skills
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on learning Python however I know basics of many different languages (such as HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL, C++) 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any cool project so that I can get even more experienced as a programmer
- âš¡ Fun fact: Currently I own 3 tarantulas
- ðŸ”¥ I strongly appreciate the practicality of the applications I create
